Pinecone is a cloud-based vector database optimised for machine learning applications. It is designed to efficiently store and retrieve dense vector embeddings, making it ideal for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with long-term memory and improving their performance in tasks such as natural language processing. It offers quick data retrieval, ideal for chatbots, and includes a free tier for storing up to 100,000 vectors. Although there are open-source vector databases available like Chroma, Weaviate, and Milvus, Pinecone is preferred for its simplicity and ease of use.
